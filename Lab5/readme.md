## Lucidchart
Is a software that helps users sketch and share profession flowchart diagrams, provides designs for anything from brainstorming to project management. In addition Lucidchart provides a means for collaborative online diagramming to make it easy to draw flowcharts, organization charts and much more. In my experience using flowchart diagrams software, the Lucidchart was the easiest to use and will be my go to charting software in the future.

## Introduction to Networking
Includes data transmission, packet, packet-switching, IP address, DNS and protocols.

### Data Transmission
The following terms packet, packet-switching, IP address, DNS and protocol definitions are below. All these terms are related: because all the terms these terms relate to the internet. Each term does have unique match assets of their set of rules to allow devices to communicate ,unit of data, unique identifying number ,technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address and directory of IP address common names.

#### Packet
Is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the internet. An example of this is when a PC host intends to send a message to another PC host the information is broken down into smaller pieces called packets. Each packet has a sender’s address, destination address, a sequences number and a piece of overall information to be sent. Different packets in  a single message can take of variety of routes so this is the reason for the sequence number to ensure the reassemble of packets in done in proper order. Unique identifier is the sequence number.

#### Packet-Switching
As message packets are sent on the Internet, routers try to find the optimal route for each packet. This can result in packets being sent on different routes to their destination. After packets arrive they are re-assembled into the original message. Unique identifier is the sequence number.

#### IP Address
A unique identifying number called an IP (Internet Protocol) address is assigned; every device on the Internet (personal computer, a tablet, a smartphone, etc.).

#### DNS
DNS is the abbreviation for domain name server. The DNS act as the directory of websites on the Internet. The basic function is when a request to access a host with a domain name is given the DNS server is queried and returns the IP address to the host allowing for proper routing. Unique identifier is the IP address.

#### Protocol
Is the set of rules that govern how communications take place on a network. For example, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are the communication rules for transferring files from one host to another. TCP/IP, is known as a protocol suite since it contains numerous protocols.

### Networking Hardware
Includes switch vs hub, router vs switch and hub and network topologies.

A brief comparison of Switch vs. Hub and Router vs. Switch and Hubs is discussed next

#### Switch vs. Hub
Hubs are basically are devices that pass on anything received on one connection to all other connections. Hubs may create security and bandwidth issues. Switches are semi-intelligent devices that learn which devices are on which connection. So switches can be more selective with information and reduces unnecessary information passing

#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
And when adding routers to the comparison, one will note routers are essentially small computers that perform a variant of intelligent tasks. Routers routes data via IP addresses for its own network. Router is basically a gateway to a network.  So with that said switches are semi-intelligent devices that learn connections; whereby hubs just pass on anything. Hubs & Switches are used to create networks and Routers are used to connect networks. Routers are essential small computers than perform intelligent tasks. 

### Network Topologies
Network topology is a layout how a network communicates with different devices. There a two categories wired and wireless. 

#### Single point of Failure
A single point of failure is essentially a flaw in a design, configuration or implementation of a system, circuit or component that poses a potential problem. An example of single point of failure is a single piece of equipment like a network device that may impact one or application in a process, the whole system fails. And a network topology refers to the manner in which links and nodes of a network are arranged to relate to each other. The single point of failure and topologies are important network concepts to understand because singe point failures and topology failures can cause numerous problems in a network.

#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
In comparing the  infrastructure vs. wireless Mesh; one will note infrastructure use wired and wireless you are connecting your devices using a central device. It uses wired and wireless and can connect multiple devices. Whereby the wireless mesh is connected wireless and wireless devices can connect to the internet. Each wireless device  will connect to nearest wireless access point to the internet, even if one access point fails the others will continue due to its redundant nature. The wireless mesh appears better due to the fact of its redundancy and use of wireless.

### Network Design
Network design is an important decision to make based on available equipment, organiation needs, cost and type of topology one wants to design.

### NSA/CSS
The NSA/CSS is operates under the Defense Agency. This agency leads the US in cryptology that includes both signal intelligence and information assurance products, service and enables computer network operation to gain a decision advantage for the nation and the nation’s allies.

## Cybersecurity and Encryption
Encryption is a cybersecurity measure that protects private and personal data by using unique codes that scramble the data and make impossible for intruders to read. Encryption is an important part of cybersecurity due to the fact it assists in protecting sensitive data and can enhance security of communication between different applications and servers. So if your data is encrypted it will be difficult for unauthorized users to gain access

### Information Systems Security
Are important concepts to understand in detail. The security triad is one part of looking at information system security, however there is much more to system security.

#### Security Triad
The components of security triad are confidentiality, integrity and availability. Each one of these components of security could impact the approach of amazon.com on an online chat- by if the system did not have confidential protection everyone would be able to view your chats and if the chat line did not have integrity someone might be able to modify your online chats and if the online chat system did not offer reasonable availability there would be issues for the users. Amaon.com needs to consider all three components for an online chat.

#### Authentication
Can be accomplished by identifying someone through something they know, something they have or something they are. Three daily tasks the require authentication are accessing e-mail, accessing bank accounts and accessing school systems. Each one of these can be converted to a multi-factor authentication by using and RSA Secure ID token that requires you to have and generates a new code every sixty seconds and requires a four digit pin.

#### ACL and RBAC
The purpose of access control list and role based access control is to ensure the user can only access the information appropriate the user.  Access control list just by users name and role based access control is by users role. The advantages of ACL is it is simple and easy to maintain , however the ACL is harder because the administration part is maintained separately  and when the number of users increase it becomes difficult. RBAC  advantage is it assigns users roles and the roles are assigned access and therefor allows the administrator to manage users and roles separately.

#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
In the public key the sender must have a public key to send message, the ciphertext is the encrypted message and the private key use by the receiver to decrypt the message. This requires the sender and receiver to have private key and public key.

#### Public Key Cryptography
Public key is used to encrypt a message that is sent

### Cryptography
#### Encryption
#### Frequency Fingerprint
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
#### Polyalphabetic Example

#### Brute-Force
