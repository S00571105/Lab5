## Executive Summary 
This section covered identification of networking components of understanding the history and development of network technologies, terns of network technologies, importance of broadband technologies and organizational networking. Along with the description of topologies, diagrams and the role of NSA in networking security. The section also defined encryption technologies and approaches to cybersecurity. In addition this section covered the following topics identification of information security triad, identification of high level concepts surrounding information security tools and securing yourself  digitally

## Lucidchart
Is a software that helps users sketch and share profession flowchart diagrams, provides designs for anything from brainstorming to project management. In addition Lucidchart provides a means for collaborative online diagramming to make it easy to draw flowcharts, organization charts and much more. In my experience using flowchart diagrams software, the Lucidchart was the easiest to use and will be my go to charting software in the future.

## Introduction to Networking
Includes data transmission, packet, packet-switching, IP address, DNS and protocols.

### Data Transmission
The following terms packet, packet-switching, IP address, DNS and protocol definitions are below. All these terms are related: because all the terms these terms relate to the internet. Each term does have unique match assets of their set of rules to allow devices to communicate ,unit of data, unique identifying number ,technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address and directory of IP address common names.

#### Packet
Is the fundamental unit of data transmitted over the internet. An example of this is when a PC host intends to send a message to another PC host the information is broken down into smaller pieces called packets. Each packet has a senderâ€™s address, destination address, a sequences number and a piece of overall information to be sent. Different packets in  a single message can take of variety of routes so this is the reason for the sequence number to ensure the reassemble of packets in done in proper order. Unique identifier is the sequence number.

#### Packet-Switching:
#### IP Address:

#### DNS:

#### Protocol:

### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
### Network Topologies
